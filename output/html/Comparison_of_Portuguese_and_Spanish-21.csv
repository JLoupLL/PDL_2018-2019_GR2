b;[b ~ ?];[b ~ ?] (EP) [b] (BP);In Spanish and European Portuguese /b/ is lenited after a continuant.;
d;[d ~ ð];[d ~ ð] (EP) [d ~ d?] (BP);In Spanish and European Portuguese /d/ is lenited after a continuant. In all Portuguese dialects, the consonants /t/ and /d/ have affricate allophones, happening when before a palatalizing /i/ ([d?i ~ d?i], [t?i ~ t?i], mainly in Brazil), or an elided /?/ ~ /e?/ ~ /?/ or unstressed /i/ before another (that actually becomes /?/ in Portugal), stressed one, leading to sandhi ([dVz] ? [dz], [dVs] ? [ts], [tVs] ? [ts], both in Brazil and Portugal).;
t;[t];[t] (EP) [t ~ t?] (BP);
g;[? ~ ?];[? ~ ?] (EP) [?] (BP);In Spanish and European Portuguese /?/ is lenited after a continuant.;
-l;[l];[?] (EP) [w] (BP);In European Portuguese syllable-final /l/ is velarized [?] as in Catalan (see dark l), while in most Brazilian dialects and some rural European ones it is vocalized to [w]. Caipira rhoticizes to English-like ar, while portunhol da pampa velarizes it.;
r-, -rr-;[r];[?];In Portuguese, r- and -rr- have several possible pronunciations. In most dialects, it is a guttural r as in French ([?], [?] and [?] in Portugal and Brazil, [x], [?], [?], [h] and [?] in Brazil), while in rural northern Portugal and southern Brazil it is a trilled r [r] (like in Galician). In some southern and western Brazilian dialects word final -r may be a tap (as in Portugal and Galicia), though English-like [?], [?] or [?] is more common, while in northern and eastern dialects it is guttural. In Spanish, r- and -rr- have kept their original pronunciation as an alveolar trill [r]. Intervocalic -r- is an alveolar tap in both languages [?].;
v;[b ~ ?];[v];Originally, the letters ?b? and ?v? stood for distinct sounds pronounced [b] and [?], respectively, but the two eventually merged into a single phoneme in Spanish. In most varieties of Portuguese they remained separate phonemes, and the bilabial fricative [?] of Old Portuguese subsequently changed into the labiodental fricative [v], as in French and Italian.;
