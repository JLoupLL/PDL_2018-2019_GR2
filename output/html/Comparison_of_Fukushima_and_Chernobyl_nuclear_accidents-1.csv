Years of operation before the accident;40 years (plant) 40 years (Unit 1) 37 years (Unit 2) 35 years (Unit 3) 33 years (Unit 4);9 years (plant) 2 years (Unit 4)[1];
Electrical output;plant (net): 4546 MWe (6 reactors) reactors (net): 439 MWe (Unit 1), 760 MWe (Units 2–5), 1067 MWe (Unit 6);plant (net): 3700 MWe (4 reactors) reactors (net): 925 MWe (Units 1–4);
Type of reactor;BWR-3 and BWR-4 reactors with Mark I containment vessels;RBMK-1000 graphite moderated, 2nd generation reactor without containment;
Number of reactors;6 on site; 4 (and spent fuel pools) involved in accident; one of the four reactors was empty of fuel at the time of the accident.;4 on site; 1 involved in accident;
Amount of nuclear fuel in affected reactors;4 reactors - 854 tons (81 tons in Unit 1 reactor, 111 tons in Unit 2 reactor, 111 tons in Unit 3 reactor, 0 tons in Unit 4 reactor (defueled), 59 tons in Unit 1 spent fuel pool (SFP), 119 tons in Unit 2 SFP, 104 tons in Unit 3 SFP, and 269 tons in Unit 4 SFP)[a];1 reactor - 210 tons (spent fuel pools not involved in incident)[5];
Cause of the accident;The plants were not designed with consideration of such a large tsunami. A major earthquake and tsunami caused the destruction of power lines and backup generators. Once the plants were without external power and the generators were flooded, a catastrophic decay heat casualty ensued, leading to major reactor plant damage including meltdowns and explosive loss of reactor containment.[citation needed];Proximate cause was human error and violation of procedures. The unsafe reactor design caused instability at low power due to a positive void coefficient and steam formation. When an improper test was conducted at 1:00 am at low power, the reactor became prompt critical. This was followed by a steam explosion that exposed the fuel, a raging fire, and a core meltdown. The fire lasted for days to weeks, and there is controversy over whether it was the fuel burning, nuclear decay heating or whether the graphite moderator that made up most of the core was involved. See Chernobyl Disaster, Note 1, for more discussion.;
Maximum level of radiation detected;210 Sv/h inside Unit 2 containment vessel six years after meltdown.[6];300 Sv/h shortly after the explosion in vicinity of the reactor core.[7];
Radioactivity released;As of 2014, a peer reviewed estimate of the total was 340–780 PBq, with 80% falling into the Pacific Ocean.[8] Radiation continues to be released into the Pacific via groundwater.;5.2 EBq (5,200 PBq)[9][10];
Area affected;Radiation levels exceeding annual limits seen over 60 kilometres (37 mi) to northwest and 40 kilometres (25 mi) to south-southwest, according to officials.[citation needed];An area up to 500 kilometres (310 mi) away contaminated, according to the United Nations.[citation needed];
Exclusion Zone Area;20 km (30 km voluntary) extending north-west to 45 km in the downwind direction to Iitate, Fukushima[11];30 km;
Population relocated;154,000[12];335,000 (About 115,000 from areas surrounding the reactor in 1986; about 220,000 people from Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine after 1986);
Direct fatalities from the accident;None;Two immediate trauma deaths; 28 deaths from Acute Radiation Syndrome out of 134 showing symptoms; four from an industrial accident (helicopter crash); 15 deaths from radiation-genic thyroid cancers (as of 2005)[13];
Current status;Cold shutdown declared on 16 December 2011, but decommissioning is likely to take 30 to 40 years.[14][15] All fuel rods in reactor 4 pool removed. Fukushima disaster cleanup is ongoing.;All reactors were shut down by 2000. The damaged reactor was covered by a hastily built steel and concrete structure called the sarcophagus. A New Safe Confinement structure was installed in November 2016, from which the plant will be cleaned up and decommissioned.;
