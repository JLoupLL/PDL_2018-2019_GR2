Static Contrast ratio;Over 15,000:1[1];150 to 6,600:1[2][3];3800:1[4];"?" "Inf:1"[5] Unable to be calculated as black levels are zero.;
Peak Luminosity;176 cd/m²[1];276-1460 cd/m²[3];50-200 cd/m²[1];100-700 cd/m² [6];
Color depth;24-bit per pixel resolution; offers better resolution for grayscale;6 to 10-bit per subpixel panels;[7] smaller dot pitch, better detail[8];6 to 8-bit per subpixel panels; best color gamut[9][resource out of date, not impartial][10][resource out of date; source not credible/reputable];;
Response time;Less than 1 µs[11];1–8 ms typical (according to manufacturer data), older units could be as slow as 35 ms[12];Less than 1 µs; can get up to 0.001 µs[13];;
Frame rate;60–85 fps typically, some CRTs can go even higher (200 fps at reduced resolution[14]); internally, display refreshed at input frame rate speed;60 fps typically, some can do 120 fps; internally, display refreshed at up to 240 Hz[15];60 fps typically, some can do 120 fps; internally, display refreshed at e.g. 480 or 600 Hz[16];;
Environmental influences;Sensitive to ambient magnetic fields, which can adversely effect convergence and color purity.;Prone to malfunctions on both low (below -4 °F\-20 °C) or high (above 45 °C\113 °F) temperatures[17];High altitude pressure difference may cause poor function or buzzing noises[18];;
Flicker;Perceptible on lower refresh rates (60 Hz and below)[19];Depends; as of 2013, most LCDs use PWM (strobing) to dim the backlight[20];Does not normally occur due to high refresh rate.[21];;
Size;Up to 43";Up to 108"(2.78m)[22];Up to 150"(3.8m)[23];;
Energy consumption and heat generation;High[24];Low[24];Varies with brightness but usually higher than LCD[25][26][27][28];;
Maintenance;Hazardous to repair or service due to high-voltage, requires skilled convergence calibration and adjustments for geographic location changes.[29]Glass display tube is evacuated and carries risk of implosion if improperly handled.;Risky and expensive to repair due to complexity of the display;[30] units with mercury lamps are a minor environmental hazard[31];Screen itself cannot be repaired if the gas used to generate images leaks[32];;
Electro-magnetic radiation emission;Can emit a small amount of X-ray radiation.;Only emits non-ionizing radiation.[33];Emits strong radio frequency electromagnetic radiation[34];;
Other;No native resolution. Currently, the only display technology capable of multi-syncing (displaying different resolutions and refresh rates without the need for scaling).[35] Display lag is extremely low due to its nature, which does not have the ability to store image data before output, unlike LCDs, plasma displays and OLED displays.[36]Extremely bulky and heavy construction in comparison to other display technologies. Large displays would be unsuitable for wall mounting.;The LCD grid can mask effects of spatial and grayscale quantization, creating the illusion of higher image quality.[37];Screen-door effects are more noticeable than LCD when up close, or on larger sizes;[38] Risk of image retention or 'burn-in'.;Risk of image retention or 'burn-in'. Coloured sub-pixels may age at different rates, leading to a colour shift. Sensitive to UV light from direct sunlight.;
