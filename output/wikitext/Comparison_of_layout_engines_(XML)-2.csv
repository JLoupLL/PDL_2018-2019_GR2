XSLT[8][9];{{IE|6.0}}{{#tag:ref|Trident relies on the MSXML library to implement XML processing. MSXML3 and MSXML4 implement XSLT 1.0, while MSXML2 implements the December 1998 XSL Working Draft, which predates XSLT 1.0 and is not fully compatible with it. Further complicating matters is that the MSXML libraries can coexist, but only one of them will be used by Trident, depending on a setting in the Windows Registry. Prior to the release of Internet Explorer 6, MSXML2 was the default XML library for Trident, but MSXML3 or MSXML4 could be installed separately and then registered as the default if desired. Regardless of which version was the default, any version, if installed, could be invoked directly by Microsoft-specific scripting code in the document being rendered by Trident.|group=note}};{{yes|1.0}};{{yes|314}};rowspan="3" {{no}};{{incorrect}};{{Dunno}};{{yes}};
