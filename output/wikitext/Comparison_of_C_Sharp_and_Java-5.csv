Arrays are implicitly direct specializations of <kbd>Object</kbd>. They are not unified with collection types.;Arrays in C# are implicit specializations of the <kbd>System.Array</kbd> class that implements several collection interfaces.;
Arrays and collections are completely separate with no unification. Arrays cannot be passed where sequences or collections are expected (though they can be wrapped using <kbd>Arrays.asList</kbd>).;Arrays can be passed where sequences (<kbd>IEnumerable</kbd>s) or collections/list interfaces are expected. However, the collection operations that alter the number of elements (insert/add/remove) will throw exceptions as these operations are unsupported by arrays.;
The <kbd>for</kbd> statement accepts either arrays or <kbd>Iterable</kbd>s. All collections implement <kbd>Iterable</kbd>. This means that the same short syntax can be used in for-loops.;The <kbd>foreach</kbd> statement iterates through a sequence using the <kbd>IEnumerable</kbd> or <kbd>IEnumerable<T></kbd> interface. Because arrays always implicitly implement these interfaces, the loop will iterate through arrays also.;
In both languages arrays of reference types are covariant. This means that a <kbd>String[]</kbd> array is assignable to variables of <kbd>Object[]</kbd>, as <kbd>String</kbd> is a specialization of (assignable to) <kbd>Object</kbd>. In both languages, the arrays will perform a type check when inserting new values, because type safety would otherwise be compromised. This is in contrast to how generic collections have been implemented in both languages.;
No multidimensional arrays (rectangular arrays), but arrays of references to arrays (jagged arrays).;Multidimensional arrays (rectangular arrays), and arrays of references to arrays (jagged arrays).;
Arrays cannot be resized (though use of the <kbd>System.arraycopy()</kbd> method can allow for multi-step array resizing);Arrays can be resized while preserving existing values using the <kbd>Array.Resize()</kbd> static array method (but this may return a new array).;
Implemented as a retrofit for the <kbd>java.util</kbd> library having extra features, like data structures like sets and linked sets, and has several algorithms to manipulate elements of a collection, like finding the largest element based on some <kbd>Comparator<T></kbd> object, finding the smallest element, finding sublists within a list, reverse the contents of a list, shuffle the contents of a list, create immutable versions of a collection, performs sorts, and make binary searches.[35];The C# collections framework consists of classes from the <kbd>System.Collections</kbd> and the <kbd>System.Collections.Generic</kbd> namespaces with several useful interfaces, abstract classes, and data structures.[36] NET 3.5 added <kbd>System.Linq</kbd> namespace that contains various extension methods for querying collections, such as <kbd>Aggregate</kbd>, <kbd>All</kbd>, <kbd>Average</kbd>, <kbd>Distinct</kbd>, <kbd>Join</kbd>, <kbd>Union</kbd> and many others. Queries using these methods are called Language Integrated Query (LINQ).;
