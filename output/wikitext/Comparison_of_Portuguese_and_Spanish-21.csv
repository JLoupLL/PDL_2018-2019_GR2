b;{{IPA|[b ~ ?]}};{{IPA|[b ~ ?]}} (EP) {{IPA|[b]}} (BP);In Spanish and European Portuguese {{IPA|/b/}} is lenited after a continuant.;
d;{{IPA|[d ~ ð]}};{{IPA|[d ~ ð]}} (EP) {{IPA|[d ~ d?]}} (BP);In Spanish and European Portuguese {{IPA|/d/}} is lenited after a continuant. In all Portuguese dialects, the consonants {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} have affricate allophones, happening when before a palatalizing {{IPA|/i/}} ({{IPA|[{{IPA link|d?}}i ~ {{IPA link|d?}}i]}}, {{IPA|[{{IPA link|t?}}i ~ {{IPA link|t?}}i]}}, mainly in Brazil), or an elided {{IPA|/?/ ~ /e?/ ~ /?/}} or unstressed {{IPA|/i/}} before another (that actually becomes {{IPA|/?/}} in Portugal), stressed one, leading to sandhi ({{IPA|[dVz] ? {{IPAblink|dz}}}}, {{IPA|[dVs] ? {{IPAblink|ts}}}}, {{IPA|[tVs] ? [ts]}}, both in Brazil and Portugal).;
t;{{IPA|[t]}};{{IPA|[t]}} (EP) {{IPA|[t ~ t?]}} (BP);
g;{{IPA|[? ~ ?]}};{{IPA|[? ~ ?]}} (EP) {{IPA|[?]}} (BP);In Spanish and European Portuguese {{IPA|/?/}} is lenited after a continuant.;
-''l;{{IPA|[l]}};{{IPA|[?]}} (EP) {{IPA|[w]}} (BP);In European Portuguese syllable-final {{IPA|/l/}} is velarized {{IPAblink|?}} as in Catalan (see dark l), while in most Brazilian dialects and some rural European ones it is vocalized to {{IPAblink|w}}. Caipira rhoticizes to English-like ar, while portunhol da pampa velarizes it.;
r-, -rr-;{{IPA|[r]}};{{IPA|[?]}};In Portuguese, r- and -rr- have several possible pronunciations. In most dialects, it is a guttural r as in French ({{IPA|[?]}}, {{IPA|[?]}} and {{IPA|[?]}} in Portugal and Brazil, {{IPA|[x]}}, {{IPA|[?]}}, {{IPA|[?]}}, {{IPA|[h]}} and {{IPA|[?]}} in Brazil), while in rural northern Portugal and southern Brazil it is a trilled r {{IPAblink|r}} (like in Galician). In some southern and western Brazilian dialects word final -r may be a tap (as in Portugal and Galicia), though English-like {{IPAblink|?}}, {{IPAblink|?}} or {{IPAblink|?}} is more common, while in northern and eastern dialects it is guttural. In Spanish, r- and -rr- have kept their original pronunciation as an alveolar trill {{IPAblink|r}}. Intervocalic -r- is an alveolar tap in both languages {{IPAblink|?}}.;
v;{{IPA|[b ~ ?]}};{{IPA|[v]}};Originally, the letters ?b? and ?v? stood for distinct sounds pronounced {{IPAblink|b}} and {{IPAblink|?}}, respectively, but the two eventually merged into a single phoneme in Spanish. In most varieties of Portuguese they remained separate phonemes, and the bilabial fricative {{IPA|[?]}} of Old Portuguese subsequently changed into the labiodental fricative {{IPAblink|v}}, as in French and Italian.;
